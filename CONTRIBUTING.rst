How To Contribute
=================

Contributions are very welcome. The easiest way is to fork this repo, and then
make a pull request from your fork. The first time you make a pull request, you
may be asked to sign a Contributor Agreement.

Be sure your pull request adds you to the AUTHORS file if you are not
already listed and adds an entry to the CHANGELOG for any non-trivial
code change.
